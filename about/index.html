About Me

The person called Lin Mohan.
Born in 2010, from a provincial capital city in northern China.
He attended a local school for middle school and entered county high school through direct promotion. As early as primary school, he started learning programming and actively participated in related activities. Although many details have gradually faded from memory, this experience laid a solid foundation for his journey in computer science.
He is passionate about exploring new knowledge, especially in the field of computer science. Coding, website development, debugging, and assembling computers bring him great joy and motivate him to continuously improve. He hopes not only to master technical skills but also to cultivate keen observation and rigorous logical thinking.
He respects historical and cultural figures, whose thoughts serve as lifelong learning role models.">
