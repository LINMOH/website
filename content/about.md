# Hello,

On the Internet, I often go by the nickname “LinMH”, and my real name is Lin Mohan. I am a middle school student from Shandong, China with a strong interest in computer science.

## About Me

> The person called Lin Mohan.  
> Born in 2010, from a provincial capital city in northern China.  
> He attended a local school for middle school and entered county high school through [direct promotion](http://jnedu.jinan.gov.cn/art/2024/5/11/art_48443_4791507.html). As early as primary school, he started learning programming and actively participated in related activities. Although many details have gradually faded from memory, this experience laid a solid foundation for his journey in computer science.  
> He is passionate about exploring new knowledge, especially in the field of computer science. Coding, website development, debugging, and assembling computers bring him great joy and motivate him to continuously improve. He hopes not only to master technical skills but also to cultivate keen observation and rigorous logical thinking.  
> He respects historical and cultural figures, whose thoughts serve as lifelong learning role models.

## Computer

Since primary school, I have been using computers and learning programming. In recent years, increased academic pressure has reduced my coding time (the pressure to get into good universities in Shandong is the highest in China. We have to start school at 6 a.m. and finish at 10 p.m.). Currently, I focus mainly on undergraduate-level computer science content and graduate exam knowledge, rather than purely working on projects.

I am studying the MIT 6.006 course:

I also build computers:

Additionally, I have a [Bilibili account](https://space.bilibili.com/2126856300) where I share computer science videos and other content of interest, with a total view count exceeding 50,000.

## Team

I initiated and built a computer science community team [TATEN](https://taten.xyz/), which currently has over 20 members. We communicate, learn, develop, and grow together.  
You’re welcome to join us, even if you’re foreigners.
